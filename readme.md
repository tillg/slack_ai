## Features & known problems

* Talk to your local LLM via Slack
* Each slack channel corresponds to a conversation.
* All the conversations as well as the system prompts are tracked in a human readable JSON file. Conversations are re-loaded from this file at Bot startup.
* Use slack commends:
  * `/system` Shows & sets the system prompt for the current channel.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Beware**
* The system is neither multi-user capable nor meant to deal with a lot of load. The conversations are read & written to a local JSON file in an *optimistic* way.
## Getting things going

* Get a local LLM running that offers access via an [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create). I used [LM Studio on my Mac](https://lmstudio.ai).
* Clone this repo 
* Make sure u have python 3.12 or so
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Create a `.env` file and edit it: `cp sample.env .env`
* Start the thing with `python app.py` and watch the logs scroll üòâ

# To Do

* Describe in the readme how to set up the bot in Slack
